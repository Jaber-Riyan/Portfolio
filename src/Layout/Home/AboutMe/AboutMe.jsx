            üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jaber Ahmed Riyan!
          </h5>

          <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl mb-5'>
            I‚Äôm a MERN stack developer passionate about crafting full-stack solutions that solve real-world problems.
            From sleek React interfaces to robust Node.js APIs, I bridge creativity and functionality.
            I thrive in the JavaScript ecosystem, building RESTful APIs with Express and Node, designing NoSQL databases with MongoDB,
            and creating dynamic UIs using React and Tailwind CSS.

            ‚ú® My Journey into Web Development
          </h5>

          <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl'>
            My journey into programming started with a simple question ‚Äî <span className='italic'>‚ÄúWhy am I learning this? Will it truly impact my life?‚Äù</span>  
            That curiosity turned into passion.  
            <br /><br />

            <span className='para-strong-line italic'>
              Ever wondered how apps come to life? I did ‚Äî and that curiosity changed everything.
            </span>  
            <br /><br />

            I began by exploring how software applications are built, and soon realized that every great developer starts with strong fundamentals.
            To build mine, I enrolled in <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Phitron Batch-3</span> ‚Äî where I learned core programming concepts through  
            <span className='para-strong-word italic'> C, C++, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), MySQL, and Python.</span>  
            <br /><br />

            Later, I transitioned into software development using <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Python and Django</span>,
            but I felt there was more to explore in modern web development.  
            That‚Äôs when I joined <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Programming Hero Level-1, Batch-10</span>,
            where I mastered <span className='para-strong-word italic'>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB</span>,
            along with version control using <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Git & GitHub.</span>  
            <br /><br />

            After completing Level-1, I successfully moved into the <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Endgame Phase</span>,
            where I worked on a <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Team Project</span> as the <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Backend Developer & Team Leader.</span>  
            Leading a team and building scalable backend systems taught me real-world collaboration, API architecture, and project management skills.
            <br /><br />

            Currently, I‚Äôve joined <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Programming Hero Level-2, Batch-5</span>,
            where I‚Äôm diving deeper into advanced technologies like  
            <span className='para-strong-word italic'>TypeScript, Mongoose, PostgreSQL, Redux, and RTK Query.</span>  
            <br /><br />

            <h5 className='text-2xl text-white font-bold mb-3 para-heading'>üí° The Type of Work I Enjoy</h5>
            <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl mb-5'>
              I love working on <span className='para-strong-line italic'>challenging projects</span> that push my limits and sharpen my skills.
              Whether it‚Äôs solving complex backend logic, optimizing performance, or designing intuitive UIs,
              I enjoy transforming problems into functional, elegant solutions.
            </p>

            <h5 className='text-2xl text-white font-bold mb-3 para-heading'>üé¨ My Hobbies & Interests</h5>
            <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl'>
              Outside of coding, I enjoy watching movies, exploring new technologies, and improving my English communication skills.
              I often watch tech podcasts and tutorials to stay up-to-date.
              I also love traveling and discovering hidden, lesser-known places that inspire creativity and fresh perspectives.
            </p>
            <br />

            <span className='para-strong-line italic'>
              ‚ú® To me, coding isn‚Äôt just syntax ‚Äî it‚Äôs solving real problems that make people‚Äôs lives easier.
            </span>
            <br /><br />

            Now, as a Junior Web Developer, I‚Äôm focused on growing my expertise, learning industry best practices,
            and building meaningful projects that create impact.
            I believe technology has the power to change lives ‚Äî and I‚Äôm proud to be part of that mission. üöÄ
