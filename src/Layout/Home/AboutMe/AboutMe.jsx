                        Iâ€™m a MERN stack developer obsessed with crafting full-stack solutions that solve real-world problems. From sleek React interfaces to robust Node.js APIs, I bridge creativity and functionality. I thrive in the JavaScript ecosystem, building RESTful APIs with Express and Node, designing NoSQL databases in MongoDB, and crafting dynamic UIs with React and Tailwind CSS.

                    <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl'>
                        My journey into programming started with a simple question: Why am I learning this? Will it impact my life? <br /> <br />

                        <span className='para-strong-line italic'>Ever wondered how apps come to life? I didâ€”and it changed everything.</span> <br /><br />

                        As I explored, I discovered the world of software applicationsâ€”built by developers who all started as programmers. I realized that every skilled developer first learns programming fundamentals before diving into development. With this in mind, I enrolled in <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Phitron Batch-3.</span> to build a strong foundation in programming. <br /><br />

                        During this time, I worked hard, solving problems and learning key technologies like <span className='para-strong-word italic'>C, C++, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), MySQL, and Python</span>. After a year of dedication, I transitioned into software development with Python and Django. However, I felt something was missing in my learning process. <br /><br />

                        To fill that gap, I joined <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Programming Hero Batch-10 Level-1</span>, where I learned <span className='para-strong-word italic'>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB</span>, and version control tools like <span className='para-strong-word italic'>Git & GitHub</span>. I also explored essential web development tools and best practices. <br /><br />

                        <h5 className='text-2xl text-white font-bold mb-3 para-heading'>ðŸ’¡ The Type of Work I Enjoy</h5>
                        <p className='text-gray-300 text-xl mb-5'>
                            I love working on **challenging projects** that push my limits and help me sharpen my skills. Whether it's solving complex backend logic, optimizing performance, or creating innovative UI designs, I thrive on overcoming obstacles and continuously learning.
                        </p>

                            Outside of programming, I enjoy watching movies. Exploring different genres and storytelling styles helps me relax and refresh my mind, giving me new perspectives and creativity for my work.

                        <span className='para-strong-line italic'>âœ¨ To me, coding isnâ€™t just syntaxâ€”itâ€™s solving puzzles that make peopleâ€™s lives easier.</span><br /><br />

                        Now, as a Junior Web Developer, I am fully committed to deepening my knowledge and continuously improving my skills. I believe that technology has the power to change lives, and I am excited to be part of this journey. Letâ€™s connect and build something meaningful! ðŸš€
